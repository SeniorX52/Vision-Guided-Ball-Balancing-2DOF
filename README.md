## Project Description
*A short overview of what the project does, its purpose, and unique features like trajectory tracking and laser-following.*

## Hardware
*List all hardware components used in the system: servos, camera, microcontroller, plate, laser pointer, etc.*

## Technologies
*Outline the key technologies: Python, OpenCV, PID control, GUI library (e.g., Tkinter or PyQt), etc.*

## Software Workflow
*Explain how the system works: from image capture to plate actuation. Include a block diagram or step-by-step.*

## Control System
*Describe the control logic: visual feedback loop, PID or state-space control, trajectory tracking logic.*

## How to Use It
*Provide setup steps, how to run the system, draw paths in the GUI, switch to laser mode, etc.*
